This is the root folder for the web page that shows lecture videos
with subtitles and keyword search

To update the content, make sure and put new .mp4 videos in the video/
folder, and .srt subtitles (with matching base name) in the sub/ folder.

Then run ./mkpages.sh to generate the main page (index.html) and player
pages for each video (playXX.html, where XX is a video base name)
This will create thumbnails and .vtt format subtitles for the web video
player
